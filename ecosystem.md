## Apache Kudu Ecosystem

While the Apache Kudu project provides client bindings that allow users to
mutate and fetch data, more complex access patterns are often written via SQL
and compute engines. This is a non-exhaustive list of projects that integrate
with Kudu to enhance ingest, querying capabilities, and orchestration.
